    h4 Goal
    p The goal is to move all cards to the four <b>foundations</b> on the upper
      right.
    h4 Turning and Moving
    p Click the <b>stock</b> (on the upper left) to turn over cards onto the
      <b>waste pile</b>.
    p Drag cards to move them between the waste pile, the seven <b>tableau</b>
      columns (at the bottom), and the four foundations. You can also
      double-click cards instead of dragging them to a foundation.
    p You may move single cards or piles of cards within the tableau. You may
      only move cards <em>off</em> the waste pile, but you may <em>onto</em> and
      <em>off</em> the foundations.
    p Any time you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that
      card is automatically turned face-up for you.
    h4 Build Rules
    p Cards on the foundations need to be stacked by the same suit from Ace to
      King.
    p Cards on the tableau need to be stacked by alternating
      color from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace).
      Empty spots on the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.
