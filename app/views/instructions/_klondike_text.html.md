#### Goal

The goal is to move all cards to the four **foundations** on the upper
right.

#### Turning and Moving

Click the **stock** (on the upper left) to turn over cards onto the
**waste pile**.

Drag cards to move them between the waste pile, the seven **tableau**
columns (at the bottom), and the four foundations. You can also
double-click cards instead of dragging them to a foundation.

You may move single cards or piles of cards within the tableau. You may
only move cards *off* the waste pile, but you may *onto* and *off* the
foundations.

Any time you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card is
automatically turned face-up for you.

#### Build Rules

Cards on the foundations need to be stacked by the same suit from Ace to
King.

Cards on the tableau need to be stacked by alternating color from high
rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Empty spots on the tableau can be filled
with a King of any suit.
